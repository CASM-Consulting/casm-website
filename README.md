# Jekyll Documentation theme

Theis site is base on [this Jekyll template](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/grayscale-theme).

# Building the site

Install `brew install jekyll` and then `gem install ....` if any of the dependencies are missing. Then run `jekyll build`.  This produces a static website at `_site`. 

To inspect the site you can open the `index.html` located therein or type `jekyl serve` to start a local webserver.

To deploy copy the output dir to `casmconsulting.co.uk:/var/www/html/`
